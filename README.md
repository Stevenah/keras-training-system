# Keras Training Script

This repository contains a system for training and evaluating deep convolutional neural networks using Keras. Using JSON based confiugration files, one can easily start and reproduce sessions which will be automatically logged to disk. This system was produced in conjuction with a master thesis written for the University of Oslo.


## Prerequisites

This system requires the following core dependencies:

* Python 3.6+
* Pip 9.0+
* Tensorflow (and required drivers if using GPU)

With the these base requirements., the remainig python dependencies can easily be installed using pip by running the following comand in the root directory of this project.

```bash
pip isntall -r requirements.txt
```
