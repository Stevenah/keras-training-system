# Keras Training Script
This repository contains a pipeline for training and evaluating deep convolutional neural networks usnig Keras. The motivation of this system stems from the large mess created when trying to keep track of multiple neural network based experiments.


## Prerequisites
This system requires the following core dependencies:

* Python 3.6+ and Pip 9.0+

With the these base requirements, the remainig python dependencies can easily be installed using pip by running the following comand in the root directory of this project.

```bash
pip isntall -r requirements.txt
```
